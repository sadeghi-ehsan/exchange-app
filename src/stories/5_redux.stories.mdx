# Redux

Redux is set up in the project along with the redux toolkit.

In general, all files related to redux are placed in the `src/store` folder.

## useAppSelector

For useSelector, it is better to use useAppSelector, which includes typescript states. This hook is located in `src/hooks/redux` folder.

```ts
import { useAppSelector } from "@/hooks/redux";
```

## useAppDispatch

For useDispatch, it is better to use useAppDispatch, which includes typescript states. This hook is located in `src/hooks/redux` folder.

```ts
import { useAppDispatch } from "@/hooks/redux";
```

## How to add a new Slice:

To add a new slice, proceed as follows:

### 1. Create a new Slice for it

First, in the `src/store/slices` folder, we create a new file with the desired name, for example, `fooSlice.ts`.

```tsx
/* eslint-disable no-param-reassign */
import { createSlice, PayloadAction } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

interface IState {
  value: number;
}

const initialState: IState = {
  value: 0
};

export const slice = createSlice({
  name: "foo",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    increment: state => {
      // Redux Toolkit allows us to write "mutating" logic in reducers. It
      // doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library,
      // which detects changes to a "draft state" and produces a brand new
      // immutable state based off those changes
      state.value += 1;
    },
    decrement: state => {
      state.value -= 1;
    },
    incrementByAmount: (state, action: PayloadAction<number>) => {
      state.value += action.payload;
    }
  }
});

// Action creators are generated for each case reducer function
export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = slice.actions;

export default slice.reducer;
```

### 2. Adding it to the list of reducers

Then we add it to the reducer in `src/store/index.ts`.

```tsx
export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: { fooSlice }
});
```

## The work is done! How to use:

```ts
import { useAppDispatch, useAppSelector } from "@/hooks/redux";

const reduxAllStates = useAppSelector(state => state);
const dispatch = useAppDispatch();
```
