# Layouts

The layout structure in nextJs has been used for the format of each page.

More details are available at this link:

[https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/layouts)

## Why?

nextJs itself has explained the reason for this structure as follows:

When navigating between pages, we want to persist page state (input values, scroll position, etc.) for a Single-Page Application (SPA) experience.
This layout pattern enables state persistence because the React component tree is maintained between page transitions.
With the component tree, React can understand which elements have changed to preserve state.

## how it works?

To assign a layout to a page, we write it like this:

```jsx
import HomePage from "@/components/pages/home";
import Layout1 from "@/components/templates/nextjsLayouts/layout1";

const Home = () => <HomePage />;

Home.layout = Layout1;
export default Home;
```

## How to write the layout itself:

In order to write a layout, it is enough to write a functional component that takes Component in the first parameter and pageProps in the second parameter.

An example of layout is implemented as follows:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { AppLayout } from "@/types/common";

const Layout1: AppLayout = (Component, pageProps) => (
  <div className="h-full min-h-screen bg-card-bg">
    <Component {...pageProps} />
  </div>
);

export default Layout1;
```

### How is it implemented?

Its structure in \_app.tsx is as follows:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { IAppProps } from "@/types/common";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: IAppProps) {
  const renderComponent = Component.layout ? Component.layout(Component, pageProps) : <Component {...pageProps} />;

  return <div>{renderComponent}</div>;
}

export default MyApp;
```
