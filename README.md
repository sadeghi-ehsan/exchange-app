# Payconiq Assessment Project

This project is a response to `Payconiq` assessment task for creating a currency conversion application to help calculate what the amount is worth in another
currency.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Running

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Running the tests

I used `jest` with `react testing library` for unit testing. You should be able to run the tests without any problem if you observe the compile instructions.

```bash
npm run test
```
